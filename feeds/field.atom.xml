Everyone eager to get at destination.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone is near the tarmac, in full expedition gear, ready to leave to Devon. Light rain, sky is gray, it is frisky as usual. We just got a &lt;strong&gt;GO&lt;/strong&gt; from the PCSP control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the last two days making and weighing boxes, as everything getting in the taxi need to be known up to the nearest 10 kg by the pilot - when we were allowed a bit less than 1.5 tons, passengers included. So what is this taxi about? Well, in my opinion, this is the best ride you will ever have in a taxi, trust me. To have an idea, check Fig. 1. I mean, seriously - this is like a combo = the pilots are awesome, they can land litterally anywhere, which is a good thing because when in High Latitudes, it is not like there is a landstrip every two miles right. Control makes sure that the weather is perfect, which may be challenging sometime. I have been flying these almost yearly since 2009 - landing on frozen lakes mostly, and with climate changes, frozen lakes are not to be trusted based on the date right, so one need to be careful. Anyway we are now going in a polar desert this time, so the risk of finding a frozen lake in July is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Twin Otter" src="https://egodin.github.io/images/Twin.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;: Twin Otter are awesome planes able to land and takeoff literally anywhere. Here is the two Twin full of our gear waiting for the GO from control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These planes are Twin Otter, owned and operated by Kenn Borek. There was three Twin Otter in rotation at Resolute this summer, and we were schedule 2 (to make 3 trips) to destination on Devon. I was assigned to the third and last one. These Twin are doing service to the Antarctic apparently, during northern hemisphere winter. Usually, more work is done during summer in high latitudes, depending on the project. In our case when the snow cover the ground, it is very unpractical to work, especially during the long nights where not much can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These planes are essential to research in remote area, since they can bring a lot of supply to extended stays, which is the case this summer with almost one month for about half the group, some are leaving after two weeks and other should replace them. See Figure 2 to have an idea of what is entering in one single plane, not counting ATV's and personal - we had 3 loads like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Twin Otter" src="https://egodin.github.io/images/Stuff.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;: This is what is entering in one Twin Otter, not counting the team or the extra ATV's. We had 3 like that, one for each plane. Mostly scientific equipment, gear and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

This is presently my first time on Cornwallis Island and also the most northern location I ever went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="PCSP" src="https://egodin.github.io/images/PCSP072016.JPG" style="width: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Polar Continental Shelf Program Resolute facility is an invaluable resource for researchers working in the High Arctic (15 July 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this place is amazing, seriously, in regard with the logistics provided and their support for our research. Staff from PSCP (Salut Yvon!) were waiting for my arrival with a pick-up truck to help me with my with my gear. The airstrip is conveniently connecting to the Storage and very near the main building so the transition between 'being seated in the aircraft' to 'let's show you your room and the kitchen' was a 10 minutes thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival I was the only one from my team, the rest of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.spacerocks.ca/"&gt;Spacerocks&lt;/a&gt; et al. were still transiting to destination. No worry I was busy; since we will be on Devon Island for up to three weeks, with 10 to 13 persons at once, I had to start looking at the state of the field gear that was left in Gordon's shelf, in addition to what will be provided by PCSP for our stay. So, let's begin by the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tripod, for optical equipments? Check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATV's x4, those Bayou 250? Check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Honda power generator, one 1000W to carry around during the day? Check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another power generator (2000W) for the base camp? Check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tents (Eureka K-2 XT) x9? Check. (more were carried up by the team).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This field portable toilet? Check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and so on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is so much more small and not so small things to check and to prepare and, luckily, the rest of the team will be there very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

Devon Island it will be! This will be quite something - as I never had the chance to visit a polar desert before. Most places I went to were quite green and wet (wetlands). Also every place I visited up to now is located south of Devon Island too.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is a map of the location of our projected fieldwork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Devon Island" src="https://egodin.github.io/images/devon.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Devon Island is located 74 degrees North. There is an ice cap on the eastern side of the Island, and the impact structure where we will stay is on the western side of the Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be about 13 at most in the camp, and a small switch of personal midcourse. We will arrive at Resolute Bay facilities (PCSP) around July 15 and leave the Arctic around August 10. It will be an extraordinary experience to work with new peoples at a new emplacement. Can't wait to be there. Still have to prepare the scientific program, time is running!&lt;/p&gt;
